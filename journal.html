<h1> Journal entry #1: </h1>                                      
<p> I have no idea what github is. Yesterday I made my github website, and got it online. I think I lost my token, but maybe not. At the moment all it says is Jonah's website. We just learned how to update our website. "cd ./desktop/[filename]", then "git add ." then "git commmit -m"[some message]"" Then "git push" Then go to your website and reload it.</p>
