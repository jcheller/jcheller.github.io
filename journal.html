<p> I have no idea what github is. Yesterday I made my github website, and got it online. I think I lost my token, but maybe not. At the moment all it says is Jonah's website. We just learned how to update our website. "cd ./desktop/[filename]", then "git add ." then "git commmit -m"[some message]"" Then "git push" Then go to your website and reload it.</p>

<p> It is now october. we just started doing stuff with the console, and with javascript. We learned the eventlisteners "keypress," "mousemove," "mouseclick" </p>

<p> I am now starting to try and make my website look nice. So far my projects are boxes, animation and console. I made it so that the dark blue boxes take you back to the projects page when you click them, and so that a box turns white when you hover over it. In animation there is a box that bounces across the screen and spins. All that console does is that is changes the background color depending on where your mouse is." </p>

<p> Its been a while. I made a jumpscare for halloween. We learned more about event listeners, and how to do functions and add sounds. The jumpscare was that when you clicked on an unassuming picture of a triangle, a star-nosed mole popped up and spun around. A monster sound also played, but the timing was off. I just made this dessert thing where when you click the page a choctlate peanut butter bar pops up. Also when you hover over a bar it disappears and plays an eating sound. It also does this weird thing where it zooms in on the background as you keep clicking. I don't know how to fix it. " </p>
