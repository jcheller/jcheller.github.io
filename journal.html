<p> I have no idea what github is. Yesterday I made my github website, and got it online. I think I lost my token, but maybe not. At the moment all it says is Jonah's website. We just learned how to update our website. "cd ./desktop/[filename]", then "git add ." then "git commmit -m"[some message]"" Then "git push" Then go to your website and reload it.</p>

<p> It is now october. we just started doing stuff with the console, and with javascript. We learned the eventlisteners "keypress," "mousemove," "mouseclick" </p>

<p> I am now starting to try and make my website look nice. So far my projects are boxes, animation and console. I made it so that the dark blue boxes take you back to the projects page when you click them, and so that a box turns white when you hover over it. In animation there is a box that bounces across the screen and spins. All that console does is that is changes the background color depending on where your mouse is." </p>

<p> Its been a while. I made a jumpscare for halloween. We learned more about event listeners, and how to do functions and add sounds. The jumpscare was that when you clicked on an unassuming picture of a triangle, a star-nosed mole popped up and spun around. A monster sound also played, but the timing was off. I just made this dessert thing where when you click the page a choctlate peanut butter bar pops up. Also when you hover over a bar it disappears and plays an eating sound. It also does this weird thing where it zooms in on the background as you keep clicking. I don't know how to fix it. " </p>

<p> Is now right before winter break, new year. I made presents for my friend charlie and reuben. The one for charlie makes a pictures of him appear each time you click a box. The one for reuben makes a different picture appear every time you click the screen. The picture also appears where you click which is cool. I used the code from the cheeseboard that I also made for it. The cheeseboard has many condiments. Each of the condiments are at the top of the screen. When you click on one, then when you click on the board, it will make that condiemtn. then you can click on the top of the screen to change the condiment you are adding. I have also ran into a problem. My website will not update even when I do all the right commands. I do not know how to solve it. It might be related to my token, which I regenerated recently because the old one expired.  </p>

<p> I have made a very good drawing tool. You can select many different colors and five sizes. You can also choose to draw with either a circle or square, though they look very similar. One thing I really want to improve about it is the max drawing speed. The code draws by creating divs where your mouse is, but if you move your mouse too fast the divs get spread apart. And "too fast" is not really that fast.</p>

<p> Because I didn't know what to do for the valentines day project, I made it for a stock photo from. The page gives you some cool facts about frogs with a valentine's day background. Bet you didnt know frogs eat bugs. It was pretty easy to make because I made it a very similar mechanic to a project I made in december.</p>

<p> I am planning on adding on array that gives you a random prompt of something to draw in the drawing tool. I don't know how to make arrays though :/ I'm also going to add a fill feature so you change the background color. </p>

<p> Fill feature was a bit tricky to add but I got it work and I am very happy with it. You can now switch between fill and drawing, and there is a red outline to indicate which one you're currently on.  </p>

<p> I made a very simple car for the car project. Also, I moved the file "something" that just has a bunch of weird stuff in it to my projects page instead of being linked on the home/index page. I now have thirteen projects which is pretty cool</p>

<p>For the random color project, I added a feature to the drawing tool that makes it so you can change the background or drawing color to a random color. It was very easy to add and I am happy with it.</p>

<p> I might have forgotten reporting writing day was today and that my website should have been fully up to date. Oops. Its update now though. Also some new addition are that I put my new projects on my projects page. Also I finally added the random prompt feature on the drawing tool. So far I put in about 50 words it cycles through. I also made it so that when the background/fill color of the page is black, the text color of the prompt changes to white, and when the background is not black the text color changes to black so you can always see it. On thing I am still trying to fix is that the first time you click the fill bucket the prompt will disappear until you change the fill color. I have also not tried to fix the max drawing speed issue yet. </p>

<p> For my final project I am working on dalton geoguessr with Cole. We will take a ton of photos of every place around school, and then the game will be that you have to guess which floor and room a random photo is from.

<p> I have started to work on some parts of the final project when I am bored. So far I have made the starting page, the difficult selection, and sort of made the time controls. Note: on starting page have instructions/about the game as well as difficulty selection.
